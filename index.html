            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Rodger, an Australian with Chinese heritage and can
              speak Japanese and a little Lithuanian. I'm known by others
              to be down to earth, calm, and approachable.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the past five years I've worked in I.T. as a consultant,
              focusing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems and I.T. automation.
              I enjoy tackling challenges, finding effective solutions, and
              appreciate how difficult it can be do that.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time I love gorillas and find inspiration in their strength
              and sometimes gentle nature. I practice boxing and judo to stay active
              and I'm always looking for opportunities to snorkel and scuba dive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fun fact! I've been working in tech for
              <span id="time-container">0</span> seconds!

            Inspired from the "starter pack" meme, e.g. <br>
            <br>
            - "The Karen Starter Pack" with images of a short asymmetrical bob cut, shouting at retail store staff. <br>
            - "The Mid-life Crisis Starter Pack" with images of a Harley Davidson and flashy cars. <br>
            - "The Finance Bro Starter Pack" with images of The Wolf of Wallstreet, boat shoes and linen shorts. <br>
            <br>
            The Enterprise Starter Pack is all the I.T. infrastructure an enterprise or enterprise wanna-be would deploy, automated through infrastructure as code. <br>
